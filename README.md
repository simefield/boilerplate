## OOCSS
*The following definition is borrowed from [Stubbornella](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)*

#### What is it OOCSS?
> How do you scale CSS for thousands of pages? Object Oriented CSS is an answer. It’s an approach for writing CSS that’s fast, maintainable, and standards-based. It adds much needed predictability to CSS so that even beginners can participate in writing beautiful websites.

#### What’s a CSS Object?
> Basically, a CSS “object” is a repeating visual pattern, which can be abstracted into an independent snippet of HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. Once created, an object can then be reused throughout a site.

Perhaps the poster-child of CSS objects is the Media object. [Take a glimpse here to see it in action](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/).
